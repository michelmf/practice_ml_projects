# Practice Machine Learning and Data Science Projects

Repo with miscellaneous projects to practice machine learning and data science from online courses, books, and other sources.

## Projects

[Finding Donors Project](https://github.com/michelmf/practice_ml_projects/tree/main/finding_donors_project) - he project is part of the Udacity's "Introduction to Machine Learning with Tensorflow/PyTorch" Nanodegrees. The goal is to build a model that can predict whether an individual makes more than $50,000.00 per year, based on the features provided in the dataset.
