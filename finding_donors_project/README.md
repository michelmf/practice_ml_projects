# Finding Donors Project

CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. With nearly 15 million working Californians, CharityML has brought you on board to help build an algorithm to best identify potential donors and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. Your goal will be evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

## Project Overview

The project is part of the Udacity's "Introduction to Machine Learning with Tensorflow/PyTorch" Nanodegrees. The goal is to build a model that can predict whether an individual makes more than $50,000.00 per year, based on the features provided in the dataset.

This project is designed to get students acquainted with the many supervised learning algorithms available in sklearn, and to also provide for a method of evaluating just how each model works and performs on a certain type of data. It is important in machine learning to understand exactly when and where a certain algorithm should be used, and when one should be avoided.

During this project, students will also learn how to apply the following concepts:

* How to identify when preprocessing is needed, and how to apply it.
* How to establish a benchmark for a solution to the problem.
* What each of several supervised learning algorithms accomplishes given a specific dataset.
* How to investigate whether a candidate solution model is adequate for the problem.

## Software and packages

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

* Python
* NumPy
* pandas
* scikit-learn
* Matplotlib

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the Anaconda distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included.

## Starting the Project

For this assignment, you can find the p1_charityml folder containing the necessary project files on the Supervised Learning GitHub(opens in a new tab), under the starter folder. This project contains three files that you will need to use:

* finding_donors.ipynb: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
* census.csv: The project dataset. You'll load this data in the notebook.
* visuals.py: This Python script provides supplementary visualizations for the project. Do not modify.

In the Terminal or Command Prompt, navigate to the folder on your machine where you've put the project files, and then use the command jupyter notebook finding_donors.ipynb to open up a browser window or tab to work with your notebook. Alternatively, you can use the command jupyter notebook or ipython notebook and navigate to the notebook file in the browser window that opens. Follow the instructions in the notebook and answer each question presented to successfully complete the project. A README file has also been provided with the project files which may contain additional necessary information or instruction for the project.
